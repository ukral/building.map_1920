# Building stock and age 1920

## Introduction
This Codebook chapter refers to the geospatial dataset "Building stock and age 1920", briefly called BSM_1920. The geographical coverage is defined by the city limits of 2020 (see Figure \@ref(fig:overview)). It is noted that the settlement area in the western part of the city (see orange coloured areas in the figure on the left) has been excluded because of data availability. The area out of scope represents about 1.3% of the total settlement area at this time.

The dataset includes `r nrow(dataset_final)` data entries (rows) and `r ncol(dataset_final)` data fields (columns). The dataset can be retrieved from the [Zenodo repository](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715200), whereas the dataset can be combined from the following files

* "BSM_1920.shp", which includes the polygon-features and an unique identifier in the data field "ID".
* "BSM_1920_attribute_table_final.csv", which is the attribute table without geometry information. It also includes the data field "ID" and therefore can be linked with the "Building stock and age 1920.shp" file.

The `r nrow(dataset_final)` polygon-features are visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:overview).



##	Attribute table
The dataset includes `r nrow(DD_T_10)` data fields. `r kable(head(DD_T_10[,1:2], nrow(DD_T_10)))` 

## Comments
This section comments on the individual data fields by giving background information and details for using the data.

###	ID
The field includes a unique character for each of the `r nrow(dataset_final)` polygon-features. The character the combination of "UD" for urban district", the district number "UD.2020", an underline "_" and an integer. Example: "UD1_1543".

It is noted that the integer at the end of the "ID" is unique per urban district and doesn't follow a specific logical order. It is also noted the series of integers has gaps, which is due to the removal and merging of polygon-features during the clean-up process and the integration of all building footprints from more than 100 different maps sheets into a single map. 


### ID.bs
The field includes a unique character for `r length(which(dataset_final$ID.bs != ""))` polygon-features. It corresponds with the data field "ID" of the [Building schematic of Vienna in the late 1920s](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4106173) dataset and therefore allows to assign data records "year of construction", "year of purchase", "cadastral community" and "floors".

It is noted that the "ID.bs" records are based on address matching between the BSM_1920 and the [Building schematic of Vienna in the late 1920s](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4106173) dataset. The addresses in the BSM_1920 dataset are not completely verified, because we were not able to reconstruct the address data of 1920 based on address labels in historical building stock maps. 

### Area
The field specifies the area of the polygon-feature in squared meters. It is noted that polygon-features represent built-up land but not necessary buildings in a definitional sense.

###	UD.1920
The field specifies the location of the polygon-feature with respect to the urban district distribution in 1920. At this time, the city was divided into 21 districts.

The field covers the following unique records: `r sort(unique(dataset_final$UD.1920), na.last = T)`. The integers `r min(dataset_final$UD.1920, na.rm=T)`-`r max(dataset_final$UD.1920, na.rm=T)` stand for the number of the urban districts. "NA" records are for polygon-features beyond the city boundary 1920.

### UD.2020
The field specifies the location of the polygon-feature with respect to the urban district distribution in 2020.

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$UD.2020)`. The integers `r min(dataset_final$UD.2020, na.rm=T)`-`r max(dataset_final$UD.2020, na.rm=T)` stand for the number of the urban districts.

###	Location.city_limit_1920
This data field specifies if the polygon-feature is located inside our outside the city boundary of 1920.

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Location.city_limit_1920)`.

###	Location.abam_1920
The [analog building age map 1920](https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Baualter_1920) covers `r round(as.numeric(st_area(SABAM_1920)/st_area(CB_1920)*100),digits=0)`% of the city area at this time. This field specifies if the polygon-feature is inside or outside of the coverage area of the [analog building age map 1920](https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Baualter_1920).

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Location.abam_1920)`.

###	Polygon.source_id
The field identifies the data sources from which the building footprints were retrieved. The field covers `r length(unique(dataset_final$Polygon.source_id))` unique records. The first two positions indicate the type of data source, whereas

* "FF" stands for "Fortführungsmappe" (in German). It is an analog cadastral map sheet, which we used to vectorize building footprints. The cadastral maps sheets are available in TIFF format and can be retrieved from [Federal Office of Metrology and Surveying (BEV)](https://www.bev.gv.at). The nomenclatur is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:nomenclatur).

```{r nomenclatur, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "30%", fig.cap = "Nomenclatur for identifying historical cadastral map sheets.", echo=FALSE}

include_graphics(paste(dir_github, "Figures/Codebook_figure_FF.png", sep = ""))
```



* "FW" stands for "Feuerwehrplan" (in German). It is an historic fire brigade map sheet, which we used to vectorize building footprints. The cadastral maps sheets are available in TIFF format and can be retrieved from [Federal Office of Metrology and Surveying (BEV)](https://www.bev.gv.at).

* "MA" stands for "Magistratratsabteilung" (in German). It is the city authority - department 41, who provided the polygon-features. The polygon-features can be retrieved from [Open Data Österreich](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/7cf0da04-1f77-4321-929e-78172c74aa0b).
* "BE" stands for "Bezirksplan" (in German). It covers historic urban district maps. The urban district maps  are available in TIFF format and can be retrieved from [Municipal and Provincial Archives of Vienna ](https://www.wien.gv.at/kultur/archiv).
* "BA" stands for "Baualterskarte" (in German). It is the [analog building age map 1920](https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Baualter_1920). It covers historic urban district maps. The urban district maps  are available in TIFF format and can be retrieved from [Municipal and Provincial Archives of Vienna ](https://www.wien.gv.at/kultur/archiv).

###	Polygon.source_name
This field groups the "Polygon.source_id" records by the type of the cartographic document into: `r unique(dataset_final$Polygon.source_name)`.

###	Editor
The field covers name of the person who digitized the builing footprints from analog maps or the institution that provided the polygon-features. 

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Editor)`. 

###	CD.abam
The field covers construction periods of buildings, which were retrieved from the [analog building age map 1920](https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Baualter_1920).

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$CD.abam)`. Blank records indicate that no information is available.

###	CD.bs
The field covers construction years of buildings, which were retrieved from [Building schematic of Vienna in the late 1920s](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4106173).

It is noted that the assignment of construction years is based on address matching and the addresses in the BAM_1920 were not entirely validated. It is also noted that the BSM_1920 includes polygon-features with multiple addresses. Due to the address matching, these polygon-features potentially got multiple construction year assignments.

The field covers `r length(unique(dataset_final$CD.bs))` unique records.

### TP_pub.date
The field stands for the temporal presence of the building footprint. The temporal presence was retrieved from the publication data of the analog building stock map, from which we retrieved and digitized the building footrint. In other words, the presence is confirmed if the builing is shown on the analog buildig age map. The temporal presence is either given by years or periods. Periods are given for the cadastral map sheets (see data field "Polygon.source_id"), because the map sheets were used to record changes in a specific period.

The field covers the following unique records: `r length(unique(dataset_final$TP_pub.date))`. 

### TP_pub.date_year
The field includes either the year or the end of the period as given in "TP_pub.date". It documents the temporal presence of the building footprints by a single year.

The field covers the following unique records: `r sort(unique(dataset_final$TP_pub.date_year))`.

### TP_pub.date_period
This field groups the "TP_pub.date_year" records into the following periods: `r sort(unique(dataset_final$TP_pub.date_period))`.

### PoC
This field covers the building's period of construction. The periods were retrieved from "CD.abam", "CD.bs" and "TP_pub.date_year" and harmonized as followed: `r sort(unique(dataset_final$PoC))`.

It is noted that the periods include two distinctive types. Firs, periods with a timespan of 10 years. Second, periods that indicate that the building has been constructed before a given year (e.g. 0-1850).

### PoC.source_name	
This field specifies the data source from which the "PoC" records were retrieved. The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$PoC.source_name	)`.

### ID.Address.2019
The "Address.2019" records were retrieved on 6 July 2019 from the address database [Adressen Standorte Wien](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/1d5c2411-9719-4c8f-b99d-57a5f4a4ae41). It's data field "OBJECTID" is identical with the data field "ID.Address.2019".

### Address.2019_reloc
The "Address.2019" records were retrieved from the address database [Adressen Standorte Wien](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/1d5c2411-9719-4c8f-b99d-57a5f4a4ae41) as point data. Points that were located outside of polygon-features were re-located to the inside of polygon-features close by. This enables the assignment of address data to polygon-features. This data field specifies if the address point was manually re-located.  

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Address.2019_reloc)`.

### Address.2019
The field specifies the address in 2019, in particular the name of the traffic area and the orientation number. This field corresponds with "NAME" in the address database [Adressen Standorte Wien](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/1d5c2411-9719-4c8f-b99d-57a5f4a4ae41).

The field covers `r length(unique(dataset_final$Address.2019))` unique records.

### Address.1920
The field specifies the address in 1920, in particular the name of the traffic area and the orientation number. It is noted that the address data are not entirely validated.

The field covers `r length(unique(dataset_final$Address.1920))` unique records.

### Address_reviewed
We reviewed some "Address.2019" records to verify if the address was valid in 1920. This data field specifies if the "Address.2019" record was reviewed or not. 

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Address_reviewed)`.

### Address_revised
Addresses under review (see “Address_reviewed”) were revised based on the address labels in historical building stock maps (see "Address_reviewed"). This data field includes all addresses, as shown on historical buildings stock maps with address labels, that refer to the polygon-features. This data fields includes the "Address.2019" record if it is valid for 1920 too, as well as additional addresses. It is noted that multiple addresses (e.g. for corner buildings) are separated by a comma (";").

The field covers `r length(unique(dataset_final$Address_revised))` unique records.

### Location.usm
The analog urban sprawl map [Die räumliche Ausdehnung Wien von 1857 bis 1957](https://catalogplus.tuwien.at/permalink/f/8j3js/UTW_alma2158906410003336) documents the built-up area in 1918. This field specifies if the polygon-feature is located within the built-up area 1918. The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Location.usm)`.

### Location.lsm
The land use map documents the built up area 1912. The map is available in SHP format and can be retrieved from [S. Hohensinner](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3517-0259) based on personal request. This field specifies if the polygon-feature is located within the built-up area 1918. The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Location.lum)`.

### Presence.conf
The data field combines the information from “Location.usm” and “Location.lum” and confirms if the building footprint can be found in one of the two types of built-up areas. Building footprints outside of the built-up areas are considered as long as the temporal presence "TP_pub.date_year" equal or before 1921.

The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$Presence.conf)`.

### CD.bs_fit
This data fields shows if the construction year “CD.bs” fits within the period of construction “PoC”. The field covers the following unique records: `r unique(dataset_final$CD.bs_fit)`.
The data record are interpreted as followed:

* "included": The construction year "CD.bs" is within the period of construction "PoC".
* "before": The construction year "CD.bs" is before the start year of the period of construction "PoC".
* "after": The construction year "CD.bs" is after the end year of the period of construction "PoC".
* "ambiguous": The "CD.bs" records include multiple years, which are within two distinctive periods of construction "PoC". So, the "CD.bs" record cannot be assigned to a single period.
* "No 'CD.bs' record": The polygon-feature has no "CD.bs" record.
