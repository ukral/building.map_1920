# "building.map_1920"

**This GitHub repository refers** to the datasets in the Zenodo repositories, [Building age map, Vienna, around 1920](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715200) and [City boundary and urban district boundaries, Vienna, 1920](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4323010) and therefore supplements the article "Data description of '“'Building age map of Vienna and its surroundings around 1920'" in [Data in Brief](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief). It is noted that the article is currently under review.

**This GitHub repository provides** supplementary material as followed.

1. **Codebook**. The Codebook specifies the data format, the data fields and comments on the data fields of the datasets BSM_1920.shp and the attribute table BSM_1920_attribute_table.csv, CB_1920.shp and UDB_1920.shp. The Codebook also includes an interactive map with the location and geographical scope of the study area. The Codebook is available in a [PDF version](https://github.com/ukral/building.map_1920/blob/main/Codebook.pdf) for end-users as well as [R Markdown file](Codebook.Rmd) for those who want to use and re-use the Codebook.

2. **Usage code**. The [R Markdown file](Usage_code.Rmd) allows the following to be reproduced.

*	The “BSM_1920_attribute_table.csv” includes 28 data fields (= columns), including 22 stage 1 and 6 stage 2 data fields (see [Background data.xlsx](Background_data.xlsx), tab "DD_OOT2"). The stage 1 data fields were generated by using external data sources and are used to compute the data records in stage 2 data fields. This usage code imports the 22 stage 1 data fields from “../02_Zenodo/BSM_1920_attribute_table.csv”, computes the 6 stage 2 data fields and exports all 28 data fields to “../03_Output/BSM_1920_attribute_table.csv”. The usage code can be adapted to change the data records for secondary data fields. For instance, the period of construction “PoC” records can be defined by re-categorizing the construction dates.
*	The usage code reproduces Figures presented in the corresponding article.
* The usage code reproduces the aforementioned Codebook.

The usage code also available in a [readable online version](https://rpubs.com/ukral/710505) for end-users.

3. **Background data**. The file [Background_data.xlsx](Background_data.xlsx) is a compilation of tables and datasets. The sheet "Content page" provides and overview, descriptions and references for the included data

**Instruction to execute the R Markdown files**

1. Download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and install it on  your desktop.
2. Download [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/) and install in on your desktop.
3. Download the data repositories [Building age map, Vienna, around 1920](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715200) and [City boundary and urban district boundaries, Vienna, 1920](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4323010), unpack the sub-directories and save them to a local directory on your desktop (e.g. ../building.map_1920/02_Zenodo/).
4. Download the GitHub repository and save the files to a local directory on your desktop (e.g. ../building_map/01_Github/). Alternatively, you can connect R Studio to GitHub ([instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)).
5. Open R-Studio and load the R project file "building.map_1920.Rproj" from from your local directory (e.g. ../building.map_1920/01_Github/).
6. Create a new directory to save the output files (e.g. ../building.map_1920/03_Output/)
7. Specify the path name of your local directory in the chunk "specify_inputs" of the R Markdown files "Codebook.Rmd" and "Usage_code.Rmd".
8. Execute the R Markdown files in R-Studio.
9. The R Markdown files can be fed to [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) to generate a readable HTML file.
