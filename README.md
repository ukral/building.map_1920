**This GitHub repository refers** to the Zenodo repository [Map of Viennese building stock and its age in the 1920s](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3715200). It is noted that the access to the Zenodo repository is currently restricted, because a corresponding Data Descriptor is currently under review at [Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/). Once the Data Descriptor is published, there will be an open access and the following files can be used and re-used.

1. City boundary 1920 (CB_1920.shp)
2. Urban district boundaries 1920 (UDB_1920.shp)
3. Scope of analog building age map 1920 (SABAM_1920.shp)
4. Building stock and age 1920 (BSM_1920.shp) and its attribute tables (BSM_1920_attribute_table_final.csv and BSM_1920_attribute_table_temporary.csv)

**This GitHub repository provides** supplementary material as followed.

1. **Codebook**. The Codebook specifies the data format of the aforementioned 4 files, the fields of the attribute tables and comments on the fields to faciliate data usage and interpretation. The Codebook also includes an interactive map with the location and geographical scope of the study area. The Codebook is available in a [readable online version](https://rpubs.com/ukral/699029) for end-users as well as [R-Code](Codebook.Rmd) for those who want to use and re-use the Codebook.

2. **Usage code**.
